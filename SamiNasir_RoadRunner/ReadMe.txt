1. I made this game from the reference of 'Crossy Road'.
2. I really played it alot, due to familiarity I choose this game.
3. Spawn position of obstacles according to project screen, 
it was really a tough task for me. but i created an empty object places it over different positions and get to 
know the actual prespective of the required position.
